# Stock Market Analysis 
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Reliance stock data using Python and a suite of data analysis libraries. The project goes beyond standard stock performance analysis to incorporate compliance-focused features and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) anomaly detection, making it a unique blend of financial analysis and regulatory technology.

## Overview
This project analyzes stock data, including opening and closing prices, highs and lows, and trade volumes, to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies. Using techniques like seasonal decomposition, expanding window functions, and machine learning, the analysis provides actionable insights while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Key Features:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Comprehensive exploration of stock data trends and distributions.
2. Technical Indicators: Daily returns, moving averages, and more for trend and performance evaluation.
3. Anomaly Detection: Integration of Isolation Forest for AML-focused anomaly detection in trade volumes and prices.
4. Visualizations: Dynamic and static visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly to uncover patterns and flag unusual activity.

## Project Goals
1. Identify trends and patterns in stock data for better decision-making.
2. Detect anomalous transactions using machine learning to aid AML efforts.
3. Provide reproducible, transparent analysis for financial and compliance insights.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
Analysis Techniques: Expanding window functions, seasonal decomposition
